						Quick throwback, I gave a talk here 2 years ago about angular, and took the opporutnity to also
						champion typescript, and at the time it felt like a big limb that angular was climbing out on to.
						But today, typescript is taking over, with either major libraries/projects
						(anyone use vs code? Rxjs? Angular, vue, ionic,  nativescript, typeorm, )
						being written in typescript, or nice up to date typings for the projects.
						I’m the last person to push a microsoft project, I still use atom,

							Typescript is currently 10th most popular language for 2019. It's one of the most
							loved languages and most wanted. The downloads on npm show typescript is being downloaded
							and use wayyyy more than flow, and is even being downloaded more than babel or react.

							Ok, how many people use javascript currently? What about typescript? Ok, and so angular
							 is already written in typescript, where my angular fans at? Ok, and vue 3 is being
							 rewritten entirely in typescript, how many people using vue? Typescript has already
							 been supported as a built in option for vue since v2, but now the typescript experience
							  in vue is going to get a whole lot better. And who’s using evil facebooks react?
								 Seems like React has been slower to adopt typescript, afaik because facebook has been promoting flow,
								  which is an alternate strategy for typing, but isn’t nearly as nice.
									 However, now, even facebook create-react-app has added a tyepscript option so
									 the hard parts of getting started with typescript are done for you.
									 What about people using node on the backend? Or people who want to use node?

						- ok, before we look at types, lets just look at a vanilla es6 mini app here
						- we've got a greeter class, with a constructor and one method
						- we can call that one method, and update our app, and now we're greeting chris
						- ok, lets make it just a tiny bit more interesting, lets have a list of people we want to greet
						  and every second greet a new person. We can do that really easily with a little rxjs magic. for
							those people not using rxjs, you can think of it as a way to handle a stream of promises.
						- in this case, we kinda faking the promise part, but you could image you were getting a new value asynchronously
						  every second, and than we have to do something with it.
						- Immediately we can see problems with this. Javascript doesnt care about adding numbers and strings
						- It doesnt care about sending things that are not strings to our function thats only setup to deal with strings
						- and if we uncomment the end, it wont complain about non existent methods until runtime
						- and will fail with undefined if we forget the mandatory constructor argument.

						- And here's the typescript version. Not very different.
						- We can see a few differences, we have class properties with is an es7 feature i believe, I'll talk about typescript as a transpiler next.
						- We have our first types. AppDiv has been and always will be and HtmlElement class, with specific methods and properties
						  but as far as js was concerned, those things only mattered at runtime.
						- We can jump to the definition of the html element class, and find things, like the name of the innerHTML method
						- Now, we can see what we've always been dealing with, but its clear during development and compile time.
						- The constructor takes a shortcut, if you use the esnext access modifiers we get private, public, protected, etc. and it
						  also automatically makes that argument a property of the class. Show it
					  - The greet method is similar, but the string argument now specifies a string
						- Part of the reason you don't see many differences is because typescript is also smart enough to do type inference
						- Type inference says if you make a variable equal to a string, let's infer that it's a string. If you have a function
						   that returns a promise, then let's assume it returns a promise. Which brings me to my next example. What if we wanted
							 to get this greet value from an async service (like a rest api). Well, we could start by creating a promise that returns
							 our value.
				    - As we go down, now you can start to see the typescript action, it's complaining about the string array.
						- the typed array indicates that this array is designed to only hold strings, and currently it's not
						- so lets refactor a little, automatically change the people to "goodPeople"
						- and then everything works again and doesnt complain. In this case, codesandbox is compiling the ts
						  in spite of the errors, typically this wouldnt be the case for lots of projects.
						- And now when we try to call non existent methods, we get errors
						- and we get errors if we dont supply the required constructor argument.

						Poeple will say, but it takes longer because you have more typing. This is 100% wrong.
						People will say it takes longer because you get errors. This is true, but you get the errors faster, and you arent waiting for an app to reload, and see errors in the javascript console or node terminal process. Seeing the errors while you type make it much faster overall
						People will its harder to debug - wrong again, the support for debugging typescript is excellent with sourcemaps, you can debug your typescript right from the dev tools
						“It’s only for big projects” - NO! Everytime I have to work on a non typescript project, i now pull my hair out at the lack of support for all of the above, especially auto completion and jumping to documentation.
						 Maybe do a little demo here, live typing, what the fuck is htis thing, go to express docs, figure it out, etc., vs jump to definition, remmeber, oh thats how it works, and just keep going, never leave ur editor

						- Typings are out of date, so you have to any it, or work on pushing new typings. What are typings?
						- But many times, its actually an error that typescript has caught, but the wording in the error is so confusing that it makes you think you have a bigger problem, lol.
