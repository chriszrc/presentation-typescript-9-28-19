						Quick so throwback first, I gave a talk here 2 years ago about angular, and took the opporutnity to also
						champion typescript, and at the time it felt like a big limb that angular was climbing out on to.
						But today, typescript is taking over, with major libraries and projects using or supporting it.
						(anyone use vs code (you've already got typescript support built right in)?
						 Rxjs? Angular, vue, ionic,  nativescript, typeorm, nestjs, even redux for react )
						being written in typescript, and id say most major libaries (think d3, etc) have fairly up to date typings for the projects.
						I’m the last person to push a microsoft project, I still use atom,
						use ms for nothing, but this project is wonderful.

						How many people are using typescript? How many are interested in using it? How about
						using it with angular? vue?  react? node?

							Typescript is currently 10th most popular language for 2019. It's the third most
							loved languages and fourth most wanted. It's also right at the top for fastest growing.
							The downloads on npm show typescript is being downloaded
							and use wayyyy more than flow (the main competition), and is even being downloaded more than babel or react.

							Part of me is surprised, but then again angular is already written in typescript,
							And vue 3 is being rewritten entirely in typescript, Typescript has already
							 been supported as a built in option for vue since v2, but now the typescript experience
							  in vue is going to get a whole lot better. Seems like React has been slower to adopt typescript,
								 afaik because facebook has been promoting flow, which is an alternate strategy for typing,
								but isn’t nearly as nice. However, now, even facebook create-react-app has added a tyepscript option so
							the hard parts of getting started with typescript are done for you.

							1. Ok, so what the heck is typescript. First off, it is a superset of javascript.
							That means all javascript is valid typescript, and unless you enable stricter typing, with no anys, no nulls, etc.,
							you can take your javascript and put it in a ts file, and transpile it, and run it and away you go.
							2. A type checker? Ok, let's see what these types are all about.

						- except, before we look at types, lets just look at a vanilla es6 mini app here
						- this is codesandbox.io, and its basically vs code in the browser. and using it here
						  so I can keep all the code samples in the presentation, rather than jumping out to atom.
							It also makes it ridicusouly easy to start a new project. (hit the plus button, show server side too)
						- we've got a greeter class, with a constructor and one method, this is all just es6
						- we can instantiate a new instance of our class, and call that one method, and update our app, and now we're greeting chris
						- ok, lets make it just a tiny bit more interesting, lets have a list of people we want to greet
						  and every second greet a new person. We can do that really easily with a little rxjs magic. for
							those people not using rxjs, you can think of it as a way to handle a stream of promises.
						- in this case, we kinda faking the promise part, but you could image you were getting a new value asynchronously
						  every second, and than we have to do something with it.
						- Immediately we can see problems with this. Javascript doesnt care about adding numbers and strings
						- It doesnt care about sending things that are not strings to our function thats only setup to deal with strings
						- and if we uncomment the end, it wont complain about non existent methods until runtime
						- and will fail with undefined if we forget the mandatory constructor argument.

						- Ok, now let's look at the typescript version. Not very different.
						- We can see a few differences, we have class properties with is an es7 feature i believe, I'll talk about typescript as a transpiler next.
						- We have our first types. AppDiv has been and always will be and HtmlElement class, with specific methods and properties
						  but as far as js was concerned, those things only mattered at runtime.
						- We can jump to the definition of the html element class, and find things, like the name of the innerHTML method
						- Now, we can see what we've always been dealing with, but its clear during development and compile time.
						- The constructor takes a shortcut, and if you use the esnext (stage 3) access modifiers we get private, public, protected, etc. and it
						  also automatically makes that argument a property of the class. Show it
					  - The greet method is similar, but the string argument now specifies a string
						- Part of the reason you don't see many differences is because typescript is also smart enough to do type inference
						- Type inference says if you make a variable equal to a string, let's infer that it's a string. If you have a function
						   that returns a promise, then let's assume it returns a promise.
				    - As we go down, now you can start to see the typescript action, it's complaining about the string array.
						- the typed array indicates that this array is designed to only hold strings, and currently it's not
						- so lets refactor a little, automatically change the people to "goodPeople"
						- and then everything works again and doesnt complain. In this case, codesandbox is compiling the ts
						  in spite of the errors, typically this wouldnt be the case for lots of projects.
						- And now when we try to call non existent methods, we get errors
						- and we get errors if we dont supply the required constructor argument.

						Which brings me to my next example. What if we wanted
						to get this greet value from an async service (like a rest api). Well, we could start by creating a promise that returns
						our value. Look at the quick view of info about promise, maybe go to definition.
						- Then use the promise.
						- what about getting our greeting asynchronously
						- ok how about from a real rest api service?
						- We can do that pretty quickly too

						- Sure, here's the default nestjs cli generated project you get when you hit the plus button and select nestjs, which
						  is my favorite typescript backend web framework.
						- So Lets enable cors
						- How about we return some json, so we'll do getName, but immediately we can see our project has problems, because
						  we haven't implemented that method in our service layer.
						- What about some expectation of what we're going to get back? We can "type" our response as a person object.
						- And we can add person to our client side project (ah the wonders of the same language on both sides)
						- And now we can get the json response from our rest api, and even know what to expect, since we're asserting
						  that the responses will be person objects.
						- Lets look at the lower level method, and what if we didnt have the imports? Remove and add @Res
						- maybe do a quick looks at what generics are with arrays of peoples coming back in responses.
						- I would be remisce if we didn't at least look at generics,

						Ok, but people will say, but it takes longer because you have more typing. I think this is 100% wrong.
						People will say it takes longer because you get errors. This is true, but you get the errors faster, and you arent waiting for an app to reload, and see errors in the javascript console or node terminal process. Seeing the errors while you type make it much faster overall
						People will its harder to debug - wrong again, the support for debugging typescript is excellent with sourcemaps, you can debug your typescript right from the dev tools
						“It’s only for big projects” - NO! Everytime I have to work on a non typescript project, i now pull my hair out at the lack of support for all of the above, especially auto completion and jumping to documentation.
